    # Nations

    Sovereign Nations can be founded by Mayors of Towns. Nations have several extra rights that Towns do not, including:

    1. The right to appoint one National Representative to the Betaworld Global Senate. Consult the [Constitution](./constitution.html) for more details on Senatorship.
    2. The right to officially ally with other Nations.
    3. The right to declare other Nations as official enemies.
    4. The right to declare war upon other non-neutral Nations.

    ## Chartering Fee

    To officially charter a Nation so that it is officially recognized by the Betaworld Global Government, you must pay a chartering fee of **b75000**. To pay this fee and establish your nation, you must first be Mayor of a Town, then type `/nation new {one-word-nation-name}`.
