Additionally, you can ask if anybody&#39;s looking for a new resident in our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/betaworld.citizens/">Citizen Community on Facebook</a>.</p><h2 id=open-vs-closed-towns>Open vs. Closed Towns</h2><p>Some towns are listed as &quot;Open&quot;. These towns allow you to move to them without any approval. To join an open Town, just use this command: <code>/town join {townname}</code>. After you&#39;ve joined an Open Town, look for a plot that&#39;s for sale and claim it as your own to begin building there.</p><h1 id=starting-a-new-town>Starting a New Town</h1><p>Not finding the kind of Town you want to be part of? Start your own! It&#39;s really as easy as finding a spot on the map that is at least 240 blocks away from another Town, and paying a <strong>b6000</strong> chartering fee to the Betaworld Global Government (this fee gets your town literally &quot;on the map&quot;, and grants you additional rights in the Global Government as a Mayor, such as a seat in the Global Congress.)</p><p>If you have <strong>b6000</strong> and want to charter a new town, just type <code>/town new {single-word-town-name}</code></p><h1 id=being-a-mayor>Being a Mayor</h1><h2 id=betaworld-congressional-representation>Betaworld Congressional Representation</h2><p>All mayors are eligible to appoint one individual as Town Representative in the Betaworld House of Representatives. The mayor may choose their self as the representative, if they wish.</p><p>Consult the <a href=./constitution.html>Betaworld Global Constitution</a> for more information about the rights and powers of a Congressional member.</p><h2 id=commands>Commands</h2><ul><li>Type <code>/town ?</code> and <code>/town mayor ?</code> for a list of all commands that you can use to customize your town.</li></ul><h1 id=can-i-be-mayor-of-more-than-one-town->Can I Be Mayor Of More Than One Town?</h1><p>No. You may only be mayor of one town at any given time, however you may make somebody else mayor of your town, then leave to start a new one if you wish. You may also abandon your town if you wish, to build another.</p></article></section></section></article></section><section class=footer><section class=information><p>Betaworld &copy; 2012-2014.
