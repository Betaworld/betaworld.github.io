<p>Betaworld is a unique modified minecraft experience in which players found their own towns &amp; sovereign nations, establish governments, draft constitutions, sign treaties, vote in a global congress, get elected to important positions, grow their power, claim land, and build glorious monuments to their names!</p>
<p>Use a wide variety of magics, technologies, and cunning to tame this hostile world, it&#39;s moon, and even other dimensions populated by indigenous peoples, horrible monsters, dangerous wildlife, and fantastic wonders.</p>
<p>Good or Evil, Ancient or Modern, you can be and build what you wish on Betaworld. Whether you want to create a mystical temple, a stalwart medieval fortress, or a modern space command and science center; Betaworld has something for everybody, and all mature players are welcome.</p>
