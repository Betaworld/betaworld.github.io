<h2 id="article-i-rights">Article. I. Rights</h2>
<ol>
<li>A &quot;Right&quot; is an idea of absolute entitlement to have something, obtain something, or to act in a certain way.</li>
<li>Rights are established, given power, and made authoritative directly by the societies that insure them.</li>
<li>Rights cannot undermine, void, alter, or contradict any other Right.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="article-ii-laws">Article. II. Laws</h2>
<ol>
<li>Whereas a Right is an ideal; laws are actual written guarantees of recourse by an insuring society against any individual that violates another&#39;s Rights.</li>
<li>Good laws apply only in specific situations with specific and reasonable recourse.</li>
<li>Each society decides for itself which Rights to guarantee with Laws.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="article-iii-constitutions">Article. III. Constitutions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Societies establish law through written documents called &quot;Constitutions&quot; which dictate government, jurisdiction, rights, and laws.</li>
<li>Enacted Constitutions officially hold supreme authority over the jursidiction for which they apply.</li>
</ol>
